# Plastic Revolution
Plastic Revolution is a mod for the game RimWorld.

## Information:
* A RimWorld mod that let's you craft different plastic materials, and from them fabrics, armor, walls, furniture and more.
* This mod has crafting recipes for Synthread and Hyperwave.
* When you enter the map, there should be plastic generated on map (unless the seed didn't yield any).

## Features:
Adds 3 researchs: (Electricy) -> Plastic Production -> Reinforced Plastic Production -> Advanced Plastic Production.

## Plastic Production allows you the following features:
*	Build Plastic Production Bench. With this bench you can craft anything added with this mod.
*	Produce Plastic from rice, corn or potatoes, or chemfuel.
*	Craft Synwool from plastic. A synthetic wool, with slightly lower stats than natural ones.
*	Sow wollon plant. A genetic modified cotton plant that yields synwool.
*	Craft Synthread from plastic.
*	Build walls, doors, furniture and some recreation structures from plastics.
*	Build plastic tile floor. Has slightly positive cleanliness.
*	Craft plastic helmet and vest. Lightweight armor, made from basic plastic. Not very protective.

## Reinforced Plastic Production allows these features:
*	Produce Reinforced Plastic from plastic and steel. A more resistant plastic. With it you can craft more resistant plastic stuff.
* Craft Steelar from reinforced plastic. Similar to real world kevlar.
* Craft reinforced plastic helmet and vest, made from reinforced plastic and steelar.

## Advanced Plastic Production allows these features:
* Produce Advanced Plastic from plastic and plasteel. A very light and strong plastic.
* Craft Hyperwave with advanced plastic and synthread.
* Craft spacer advanced plastic full helmet and armor. Light and very strong, made from advanced plastic and hyperwave.

## Suggestions:
This mod is currently stable, as i've tested it, I don't know if any changes will be made until I may start modding more.

## Compatibility:
* This mod adds a new stuff category (like metallic) added via patch operations to doors,
walls, some furniture and some recreation structures.
* Also adds this category to Medieval Times embrasure and parapet, so you will be able to build those with plastics.
That means that shouldn't be any incompatibilities with other mods.
