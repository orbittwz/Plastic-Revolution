SUGGESTIONS:
This mod is work in progress, so if you want to suggest modified stats, recipes, or new features will be appreciated.

COMPATIBILITY:
This mod adds a new stuff category (like metallic) added via patch operations to doors, walls, some furniture and some recreation structures.
Also adds this category to Medieval Times embrasure and parapet, so you will be able to build those with plastics.
That means that shouldn't be any incompatibilities with other mods.
